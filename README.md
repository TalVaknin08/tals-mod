A ROM hack of "Super Mario Advance". The first SMA hack that is not an improvement/fixing.
This hack lets you play as Eric Cartman, Luigi morphing into Tal (the person that did this hack), Peach & "Pizza Steve" headed Toad.
Rescue the Subcons from the great "Humus" Wart and explore the modified Subcon Kingdom.

I've returned to continue this hack just recently after abandoning it for 5 months.

This ROM hack is sort of a meme hack (made for fun and does not have any purposes)

It's also my first ever ROM hack, so that's pretty cool.
